# CasperBot-Website

<P>This is the website for the Casper Discord Bot</P>
<p>This website will be getting updated as the Casper Features get updated</p>
<h2>Time Frame</h2>
<p>Right now I'm not rushing to update the Casper Bot or site as I'm working on two other projects that I find much more exciting but due to the changes in 2.0 not being massive changes it should be updated within a month at most.</p>
<h3>What was used to make this website?</h3>
<p>HTML | CSS | TAILWIND.CSS | JAVASCRIPT</p>
<h4>Figma Design</h4>
<p>You can find my original Figma Design <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/AAl4oEKMb305gFS1cgYQIB/Casper-Bot?node-id=0-1&t=z5mHjE2UuigI0Xf1-1">Here</a></p>
