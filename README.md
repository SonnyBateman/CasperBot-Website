# CasperBot-Website

<P>This is the website for the Casper Discord Bot</P>
<p>This website will be getting updated as the Casper Features get updated</p>
<h2>Time Frame</h2>
<p>Right now I'm not rushing to update the Casper Bot or site as I'm working on two other projects that I find much more exciting but due to the changes in 2.0 not being massive changes it should be updated within a month at most.</p>
<h3>What was used to make this website?</h3>
<p>HTML | CSS | TAILWIND.CSS | JAVASCRIPT</p>
